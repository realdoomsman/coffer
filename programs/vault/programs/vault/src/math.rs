//! Share and fee math.
//!
//! ROUNDING POLICY (audit surface #1 — every division in this program either
//! lives here or is annotated at its call site):
//!
//!   The pool (vault) must never lose to rounding. Concretely:
//!   - minting shares for a deposit rounds DOWN  (depositor gets fewer shares)
//!   - valuing shares for a withdrawal rounds DOWN (depositor gets fewer lamports)
//!   - locked-profit remaining rounds UP        (equity stays lower for longer;
//!     conservative on the withdrawal path — see note on the deposit path below)
//!   - the withdrawn cost basis rounds DOWN     (more of the payout counts as
//!     profit, so fees are never undercharged; this favors the fee recipients,
//!     never the exiting depositor, and leaves the pool untouched)
//!   - fee amounts round DOWN                   (fees are paid OUT of the
//!     depositor's proceeds; flooring can only underpay the trader/platform by
//!     dust and can never overdraw the payout)
//!   - breaker/threshold math rounds DOWN       (trips the breaker earlier)
//!
//! Deposit-path caveat for the locked-profit ceil: a lower equity mints
//! marginally MORE shares. The discrepancy is bounded by 1 lamport of equity
//! per pricing and is absorbed by the 1000:1 virtual-share offset; using two
//! different locked-profit roundings for the two paths would double the code
//! surface for a sub-lamport effect, so we deliberately do not.
//!
//! All intermediate products are u128 with checked ops. `state::MAX_NAV_LAMPORTS`
//! bounds equity at 1e16 and therefore total_shares at ~1e19, so every
//! `shares * equity` product stays below ~1e35 << u128::MAX.
