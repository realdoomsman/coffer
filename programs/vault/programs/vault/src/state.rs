//! Account state for the Coffer vault program.
//!
//! CUSTODY MODEL (the single most important invariant in this file):
//! The `Vault` PDA is the owner of everything — it holds the SOL deposits as
//! lamports on its own account, and it is the authority on every token
//! account the vault trades through. The trader never holds a delegated key.
//! The ONLY instructions that move value from vault custody to a non-vault
//! account are the investor withdrawal instructions (which also pay the
//! crystallized performance fee) and `collect_platform_fees` (which can pay
//! only to the pinned Treasury PDA). Everything else is either an inflow or a
//! vault-to-vault move (SOL <-> vault wSOL ATA).
