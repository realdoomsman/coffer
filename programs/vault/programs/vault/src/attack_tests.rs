//! Executing tests for the attacks the security review found.
//!
//! WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The review's fourth finding was not a bug, it was
//! the absence of these: the money-moving path of a program custodying real
//! SOL had one withdrawal in its whole suite, and that one asserted
//! `isAtMost(balanceAfter - balanceBefore, valueAtRequest)` — a one-sided
//! bound that passes if the program pays ZERO. Every attack in the report was
//! a reasoned trace through source, and two of the four fixes made in
//! response to an earlier round were themselves wrong, because they were also
//! reasoned rather than run. B1 in particular: `require!(now > nav_posted_at)`
//! was believed to give the delta cap a time dimension. It gives it one post
//! per unix second, and 124 of those crush a mark to a single lamport.
//!
//! So each test below is the ATTACK, executed against the real functions, and
//! it fails if the bound that stops it is ever loosened. They are unit tests
//! over pure state transitions, not integration tests against a validator —
//! they cannot catch an account-constraint or CPI mistake, and they are not a
//! substitute for a fork test or an audit.
