//! NAV keeper marks. Audit surface #2 (NAV bounds).
//!
//! The keeper is trusted to VALUE the book, but the program clamps how much
//! damage a compromised keeper can do per post:
//!   - only the appointed keeper key may post,
//!   - the mark's slot must be monotonic, not in the future, and recent,
//!   - |delta| per post is capped at max_nav_delta_bps of the previous NAV,
//!   - increases do not hit share pricing immediately — they drip in through
//!     the Meteora-style locked-profit unlock,
//!   - decreases hit share pricing IMMEDIATELY (losses are never smoothed —
//!     smoothing a loss would let withdrawers exit above fair value at the
//!     expense of everyone remaining),
//!   - keeper-posted losses feed the daily circuit breaker, which freezes
//!     TRADING (never withdrawals) when breached.
//!
//! Note on flows: nav_lamports is program-adjusted for deposits/withdrawals
//! between posts, so the keeper must always mark from current on-chain
//! holdings, not from its previous mark (a mark computed before a deposit
//! landed will look like a large negative delta and be rejected by the cap —
//! the correct failure mode).
