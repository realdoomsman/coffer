//! Withdrawal family: request -> (redeem window) -> execute, plus
//! instant_withdraw when the SOL buffer covers it, plus cancel, plus the
//! permissionless stale-NAV escape hatch emergency_withdraw.
//!
//! INVARIANT (custody): these are the ONLY instructions in the whole program
//! that move lamports from the vault to a non-vault account, and the only
//! recipients are (a) the withdrawing depositor and (b) the vault's trader,
//! for the performance fee crystallized by that same withdrawal.
//!
//! INVARIANT (liveness): nothing here checks VaultStatus or the platform kill
//! switch. A frozen/closed/killed vault can always be withdrawn from. The
//! normally priced paths additionally gate on NAV freshness (spec), and the
//! platform can restore freshness by rotating the NAV keeper
//! (platform.rs::set_nav_keeper) — but withdrawal ENTITLEMENT must not depend
//! on anyone choosing to act, so `emergency_withdraw` opens once the mark has
//! been stale for NAV_EMERGENCY_GRACE_SECONDS and needs no keeper, no admin
//! and no trader. Between them, no combination of keeper, trader and platform
//! inaction can hold a depositor's shares hostage.
//!
//! PROFIT-SHARE SCHEME (documented deviation from full-position Drift
//! crystallization): fees are crystallized on the WITHDRAWN PORTION using its
//! pro-rata cost basis, and paid FROM PROCEEDS:
//!
//!     basis  = net_deposits * shares_withdrawn / depositor_shares   (floor)
//!     profit = max(0, gross_payout - basis)
//!     trader fee   = profit * perf_fee_bps / 10_000                 (floor)
//!     platform fee = 0 — the platform takes no cut of profit
//!
//! WHY the deviation: Drift crystallizes unrealized profit on the FULL
//! position at withdrawal time and settles the fee in shares. With
//! fee-from-proceeds (spec's chosen settlement), full-position crystallization
//! can produce a fee larger than the proceeds of a small partial withdrawal.
//! Realizing per-portion keeps fee <= proceeds ALWAYS, charges each share
//! cohort's profit exactly once (at exit), and preserves high-water behavior:
//! a position that round-trips down and back to its basis pays zero fee.
//! `cumulative_profit_share_lamports` still ratchets up with every
//! crystallized profit as the per-depositor lifetime record (Drift-pattern
//! bookkeeping, used off-chain and by audits).
