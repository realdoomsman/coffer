//! SOL <-> wSOL plumbing and rent reclamation. Every move in this module is
//! VAULT-TO-VAULT: lamports travel between the vault PDA and token accounts
//! whose authority is the vault PDA. Nothing here can exfiltrate value.
//!
//! Wrapping (into the trading float) is trade-authority gated; unwrapping
//! (back into the withdrawal buffer) exists twice: `unwrap_sol` for the trade
//! authority at any time, and `settle_unwrap` for ANYONE once the vault has a
//! matured withdrawal request it cannot pay. WHY the second one: settlement
//! must not be something a trader can decline to perform.
