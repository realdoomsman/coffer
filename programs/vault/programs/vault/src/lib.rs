//! Coffer — trader vaults with PDA custody.
//!
//! Traders open vaults; investors deposit SOL and receive shares; the trader
//! can ONLY trade. Custody sits entirely with the Vault PDA: it holds the SOL
//! and is the authority on every token account, and the trader holds no
//! delegated key of any kind.
//!
//! ==========================================================================
//! CUSTODY SURFACE — the complete list of value flows OUT of vault custody.
//! Any diff that adds to this list is a custody change and must be treated
//! as such in review:
//!
//!   1. execute_withdraw / instant_withdraw  -> withdrawing depositor
//!      / emergency_withdraw                  + crystallized perf fee to the
//!                                              vault's trader (from proceeds)
//!   2. collect_platform_fees                -> the seed-pinned Treasury PDA
//!                                              (amount fixed by accounting,
//!                                              destination fixed by seeds)
//!
//! NOTE on (2): the platform takes 0% of profit, so `platform_fees_owed` has
//! no addend anywhere in this build and `collect_platform_fees` reverts
//! NoFeesOwed on every possible invocation for any vault created under it.
//! It is kept, inert, so that vaults carrying a pre-change accrual can still
//! be swept. Treat it as dead code with a migration purpose, not as a live
//! custody surface.
//!
//! Everything else is an inflow (init_vault seed, deposit) or vault-to-vault
//! (wrap_sol, unwrap_sol, settle_unwrap, close_empty_ata, execute_swap between
//! vault-owned token accounts). sweep_treasury moves platform revenue, not
//! vault assets. close_depositor returns the depositor record's own rent to
//! the depositor.
//!
//! LIVENESS INVARIANT: no instruction can block withdrawals — and neither can
//! any ACTOR: not the trader, not the keeper, not the platform. VaultStatus
//! and the platform kill switch gate trading and deposits only. The normally
//! priced withdrawal paths are gated solely by NAV freshness, which the
//! platform can restore by rotating the NAV keeper (set_nav_keeper); two
//! permissionless paths then guarantee the promise holds even when nobody
//! cooperates at all:
//!   - emergency_withdraw — opens on EITHER NAV_EMERGENCY_GRACE_SECONDS of
//!     keeper silence OR this depositor's own request having matured and sat
//!     unsettleable for redeem_window + WITHDRAW_REQUEST_GRACE_SECONDS. It
//!     redeems against the last posted mark less EMERGENCY_HAIRCUT_BPS, with
//!     no keeper, admin or trader involvement, and it is the ONE path that
//!     ignores other depositors' reservations — otherwise a third party's
//!     abandoned request held the escape hatch shut (B3, B10).
//!   - settle_unwrap — once a matured request is unpayable, ANYONE may push
//!     the vault's wSOL float back into the vault so that it can be paid.
//!
//! The three audit surfaces (see README.md):
//!   #1 share-math rounding  -> math.rs
//!   #2 NAV bounds           -> instructions/post_nav.rs
//!   #3 swap constraints     -> instructions/execute_swap.rs
//! ==========================================================================
