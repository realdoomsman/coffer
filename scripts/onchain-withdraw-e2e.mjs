/**
 * Withdrawal E2E — proves the API's withdrawal builders drive the DEPLOYED
 * program, against a real vault, with real lamports moving.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS MORE THAN THE OTHERS. These five instructions are hand-encoded
 * — no IDL, no Anchor client — so the discriminator and the account ORDER are
 * asserted by nothing but the fact that a transaction lands. A builder with the
 * accounts in the wrong order fails at RUNTIME, in production, on the one path
 * a depositor cannot afford to have fail. And a withdrawal path that has never
 * been executed is exactly what the security review called out: the whole suite
 * had one withdrawal in it, asserting a bound that passes if the program pays
 * zero.
 *
 * What it does:
 *   [1] instant_withdraw   — burns shares, asserts the payout ARRIVED and that
 *                            the depositor's balance grew by it
 *   [2] request_withdraw   — asserts the request and the reservation are on the
 *                            accounts afterwards
 *   [3] cancel             — asserts both are released and the shares are back
 *   [4] execute / emergency — SIMULATED. Their gates (a 24h redeem window, 7
 *                            days of keeper silence) cannot be waited out here,
 *                            so instead they are asserted to fail on the
 *                            BUSINESS rule rather than on encoding. A wrong
 *                            discriminator gives InstructionFallbackNotFound;
 *                            a wrong account list gives a constraint error.
 *                            Getting RedeemWindowNotElapsed / NavNotStaleEnough
 *                            is proof the encoding reached the handler.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   E2E_VAULT=<vaultPda> npx tsx scripts/onchain-withdraw-e2e.mjs
 *
 * Env: SOLANA_RPC_URL, SOLANA_CLUSTER, SOLANA_KEYPAIR_PATH (the depositor —
 * this script withdraws ITS OWN position), NAV_KEEPER_KEYPAIR_JSON.
