// Seed on-chain vaults with devnet SOL so they have real TVL and can trade.
//
// The pump.fun creator fees are MAINNET SOL and the vaults are DEVNET
// accounts — two separate chains, no transaction moves value between them.
// So this does not touch those fees. It funds the devnet vaults with devnet
// SOL, which is free, and gets the platform to a state where deposits,
// share math and trading are exercised against real on-chain accounts.
//
// Usage:  node scripts/seed-vaults.mjs [solPerVault]
//
// NOTE on how a donation reaches depositors: it does not, on its own. A plain
// transfer raises the PDA's lamports without minting shares and without
// moving nav_lamports, so nothing prices it. What makes it land is post_nav's
// lamport floor: the keeper can no longer post a mark BELOW the vault's own
// unencumbered balance, so the next mark has to recognise the donation, and
// at that point every existing share is worth more. Seed, then wait for a
// mark.
