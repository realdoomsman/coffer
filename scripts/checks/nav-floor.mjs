/**
 * Does the B1(a) NAV lamport floor actually fire on the DEPLOYED bytecode?
 *
 * The review's fourth complaint was that every claim about this program was a
 * reasoned trace through source — nothing had been executed against what is
 * actually running. This simulates a mark BELOW the vault's own unencumbered
 * lamports and asserts the program refuses it. Simulation only: spends
 * nothing, signs nothing that lands.
