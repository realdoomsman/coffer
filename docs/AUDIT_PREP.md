# Security Audit Preparation

## Overview

This document contains all materials needed for a professional security audit of the Coffer vault platform.

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

1. **Solana Vault Program** (`programs/vault/`)
   - Anchor-based smart contract for vault management
   - On-chain custody of assets with no withdrawal code paths
   - Program ID: `8315nL9tGA3TdYC6jr2jRiB1ccDepRKdXpBVmNybtW2U`

2. **API Server** (`apps/api/`)
   - Express.js backend with Prisma ORM
   - Real-time price feeds from Jupiter/Birdeye
   - Order engine with trigger execution

3. **Web Application** (`apps/web/`)
   - React 19 + Vite frontend
   - Privy embedded wallet authentication
   - Real-time WebSocket updates

### Data Flow

```
User → Privy Auth → API → Solana Program → On-chain State
              ↓
         Prisma DB ← Order Engine ← Price Oracles
```

### Key Security Features

- **Custody**: Vault PDAs owned by program, no withdrawal instructions
- **Trading**: Only `execute_swap` instruction with Jupiter Router v6
- **Fees**: 70/30 split between depositors/trader with escrow period
- **Authentication**: Privy session signers for user operations
- **Validation**: Price impact limits, slippage protection, balance checks

## Threat Model

### Identified Threats

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized withdrawals | Low | Critical | No withdrawal code paths in program |
| Malicious trade execution | Medium | High | Price impact limits, min output enforcement |
| Oracle manipulation | Medium | High | Multiple price sources, stale price detection |
| Privy key compromise | Low | Critical | Session-based signing, no long-lived keys |
| Front-running | Medium | Medium | Slippage tolerance, max price impact |
| Replay attacks | Low | High | Transaction freshness checks, recent blockhash |
| Server key compromise | Low | Critical | Limited permissions (trade-only), rotation schedule |
| DDoS on price feeds | High | Medium | Cached prices, multiple data sources |

### Trust Assumptions

1. Solana network security (finality, validator honesty)
2. Privy app security and key management
3. Jupiter Router v6 security and routing
4. Postgres database access controls
5. Railway/Vercel infrastructure security
6. API key security for external services

## Security Checklist

### Pre-Audit Requirements

- [ ] Code is frozen and tagged (git tag `v1.0.0-audit`)
- [ ] All dependencies are up-to-date
- [ ] No debug code in production builds
- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] Database credentials are rotated
- [ ] API keys are stored in Railway secrets
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Logging is configured without sensitive data
- [ ] Error messages don't leak implementation details

### On-Chain Security

- [ ] Vault program is deployed to mainnet
- [ ] Upgrade authority is properly secured
- [ ] No backdoors or admin functions exist
- [ ] Asset transfer constraints are enforced
- [ ] Time locks on critical operations
- [ ] Circuit breakers for abnormal conditions
- [ ] Event logging for all state changes
- [ ] Audit trail for all transactions

### API Security

- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (Prisma ORM)
- [ ] XSS protection in responses
- [ ] CSRF tokens for state-changing requests
- [ ] API authentication with Privy session tokens
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/IP
- [ ] HTTPS only in production
- [ ] Secure cookie handling
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers

### Infrastructure Security

- [ ] Railway security groups configured
- [ ] Database access restricted to API only
- [ ] Secrets management via Railway
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting set up
- [ ] Log aggregation and retention
- [ ] Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- [ ] DDoS protection enabled

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Vesting Economics**: On-chain program still implements old fee split; 70/30 split is only in paper ledger
2. **Fee Escrow**: Platform fee escrow not yet deployed on-chain
3. **Real Vault Orders**: Trigger orders only work for paper vaults
4. **Oracle Reliance**: Depends on external price feeds (Jupiter/Birdeye)
5. **Single Point of Failure**: API server as central coordinator

### Mitigation Status

| Issue | Status | Timeline |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Vesting economics | In progress | Next deploy |
| Fee escrow | Design phase | Q4 2026 |
| Real vault orders | Backlog | Post-audit |
| Oracle diversification | Implemented | Active |
| API redundancy | Planned | Production |

## Test Coverage

### Critical Path Testing

- [x] Deposit/withdrawal flows
- [x] Trade execution (paper + real)
- [x] Price impact validation
- [x] Slippage protection
- [x] Balance checks
- [x] Order trigger execution

## Deployment Verification

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing on main branch
- [ ] TypeScript compilation clean
- [ ] No console errors in production build
- [ ] Environment variables set in Railway
- [ ] Database migrations tested on staging
- [ ] Health check endpoint responding
- [ ] WebSocket connections stable
- [ ] Price feeds operational

### Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Health check: `GET /api/health` returns 200
- [ ] Database connection: Postgres metrics green
- [ ] Solana RPC: `getHealth` returns OK
- [ ] Price oracles: Live quotes returning
- [ ] Privy auth: Login flow working
- [ ] Trading: Test trade executes successfully
- [ ] NAV keeper: Posting to chain successfully

### Rollback Plan

1. **Database**: Prisma migrations are reversible
2. **API**: Railway supports instant rollback to previous deploy
3. **Web**: Vercel can rollback to previous production build
4. **Program**: Anchor upgrade authority can revert if needed
