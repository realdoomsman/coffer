 * the difference between a swap executing and quietly timing out — and a
 * swap that lands late lands at a worse price than the quote it was built
 * from, which is a loss taken by the vault's depositors.
 *
 * Helius's getPriorityFeeEstimate reads the fee market for the specific
 * accounts a transaction touches, which is far better than a global guess:
 * a busy AMM pool can need orders of magnitude more than the chain median.
