// ── fee crystallization ─────────────────────────────────────────────
// The 70/30 money flow, per-portion:
//
//   profit    = gross proceeds − proportional cost basis of the shares
//               being burned (never negative)
//   perfFee   = profit × perfFeeBps / 10_000       (creator-set 10–30%)
//     ├─ traderFee    = perfFee − vested           (paid to the trader now)
//     └─ traderVested = profit × vestedBps / 10_000 (escrow, locked 60d)
//   payout    = gross − perfFee
//
// THE DEPOSITOR INVARIANT: `paidSol === grossSol − perfFeeSol`, and
// perfFeeSol is derived from perfFeeBps alone. The vesting split is
// computed from perfFeeSol AFTERWARDS and the immediate leg is the
// remainder, so no rounding in the split can ever move the depositor's
// payout by a single lamport. A depositor's economics under 30% with
// vesting are byte-identical to a flat 30%.
//
// There is NO platform cut. The 10 points that used to fund the buyback
// are the trader's — they just cannot be touched for 60 days.
//
// Losses pay gross with zero fees. Fees accrue on the vault OUTSIDE tvl
// (they are owed, not depositor equity), so per-share value is untouched
// by a fair exit and remaining depositors never subsidize fees.
