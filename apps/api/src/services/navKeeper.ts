// ── NAV keeper ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The scheduled `post_nav` poster. It exists for exactly one reason:
//
//   deposit.rs (and every withdrawal path) calls `vault.assert_nav_fresh`,
//   which reverts with NavStale once `now - nav_posted_at` exceeds the
//   vault's `nav_staleness_seconds`. Our vaults are created with
//   navStalenessSeconds = 3600 (onchainVaults.ts PLATFORM_VAULT_DEFAULTS),
//   so a real vault becomes UN-DEPOSITABLE one hour after its last mark.
//   Nothing else in this codebase posts marks. Without this loop, every
//   real vault silently bricks itself an hour after creation.
//
// WHAT THIS TICK IS *NOT*: a revaluation. A real vault's true NAV is its
// SOL buffer plus the mark-to-market value of its token positions, and on
// devnet those positions do not exist yet (both live vaults hold zero
// token accounts). So the mark this keeper posts is the vault's CURRENT
// on-chain equity — the same number the program is already carrying —
// re-posted with a fresh slot and timestamp. See `decideMark` for the full
// argument and for the marked extension point where real position marks
// (via the price oracle) get folded in once vaults hold tokens.
//
// PROGRAM GUARDS THIS LOOP OBEYS (post_nav.rs — read it before changing
// anything here; every one of these is a revert, i.e. a burned fee):
//   • keeper must be `vault.nav_keeper`      → InvalidNavKeeper  (6021)
//   • mark_slot > vault.nav_slot             → NavSlotNotMonotonic (6025)
//   • mark_slot <= clock.slot                → NavSlotNotMonotonic (6025)
//   • clock.slot - mark_slot <= 750          → NavMarkTooOld     (6026)
//   • |nav - old_nav| <= max_nav_delta_bps   → NavDeltaTooLarge  (6027)
//   • nav <= MAX_NAV_LAMPORTS                → NavCapExceeded    (6019)
// The slot is read at CONFIRMED commitment: a processed-level slot can be
// ahead of the slot the transaction actually executes at, which reverts as
// NavSlotNotMonotonic (that lesson is already written down in program.ts).
//
// DEVNET SOL IS SCARCE (~2.18 SOL, faucets rate-limit hard). Every post
// costs a signature fee (5000 lamports), so this loop skips aggressively:
// it posts only when a vault is approaching staleness, never on a whim,
// and logs the fee it actually paid plus a running total.

 * single token account, and nothing in this API has ever executed a swap on
 * chain. Inventing a revaluation here would be inventing a number. So the
 * mark is the vault's CURRENT equity, which is `vault.nav_lamports` — the
 * figure the PROGRAM maintains, seeded at init with the burned seed deposit
 * and adjusted by the program itself for every deposit (+) and withdrawal
 * (−) since (state.rs, `nav_lamports`). Re-posting it changes no valuation;
 * it only refreshes `nav_slot` / `nav_posted_at`.
 *
 * THE POINT OF THIS TICK IS FRESHNESS, NOT REVALUATION.
 *
 * The lamports-derived figure is computed too, but only as a CROSS-CHECK:
 * `account lamports − rent-exempt minimum − platform fees owed` is exactly
 * what the program treats as vault-owned SOL (state.rs `free_sol`, minus
 * the pending-withdrawal reservation, which is still NAV until the
 * withdrawal executes). For a vault holding no tokens the two must agree —
 * and for the DB-tracked vault they do, to the lamport. When they do NOT
 * agree, the difference is logged and DELIBERATELY not acted on: the same
 * gap is produced by an unaccounted SOL donation (a real gain), by SOL
 * wrapped into a trading wSOL account (not a loss at all — the value moved
 * to an account these lamports do not count), and by an earlier synthetic
 * test mark. A keeper that cannot tell those apart must not mark the book.
