/**
 * Distributing pump.fun creator rewards into vaults.
 *
 * The easy half is sending SOL. The hard half is choosing who gets it
 * without the choice being farmable, because the moment a rule pays out on a
 * number, someone manufactures that number.
 *
 * Three attacks this has to survive:
 *
 *   Sybil      — one person opens twenty vaults, seeds each with dust, and
 *                collects twenty allocations. Defended by a per-trader cap,
 *                not just a per-vault cap.
 *   Wash       — a trader deposits into their own vault to look funded, or
 *                trades against themselves to manufacture volume. Defended
 *                by counting DISTINCT depositors other than the trader, and
 *                by scoring per-share value rather than TVL.
 *   Flash      — a vault is created the day of a distribution with a lucky
 *                trade and a huge percentage return. Defended by a minimum
 *                age and by scoring over a window, not a moment.
 *
 * Nothing here moves lamports. `planDistribution` returns what WOULD be sent
 * so it can be reviewed, published, and diffed against what actually lands.
 * Handing an automated process the keys to a live wallet is a decision that
 * should be made deliberately, not inherited from a helper function.
