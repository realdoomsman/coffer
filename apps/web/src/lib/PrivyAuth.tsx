/**
 * Privy auth tree — imported LAZILY by auth.tsx.
 *
 * Privy pulls WalletConnect's entire Ethereum provider stack (~300kB) even
 * though this platform is Solana-only and account-based. Keeping it in its
 * own chunk means users who haven't configured VITE_PRIVY_APP_ID never
 * download it, and users who have get it in parallel with the app shell.
 *
 * This file is also the ONLY place Privy's Solana hooks may be called
 * (they throw outside PrivyProvider), so it publishes the WalletBridge —
 * token accessors plus sign-and-send — into AuthContext. Every other
 * component asks for `useAuth().wallet` and never imports Privy at all.
